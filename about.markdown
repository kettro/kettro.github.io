I'm Ross Kettleson, a Firmware Engineer currently at Google.
I wanted a basic blog that I could use to start writing again, and
to get myself back into the swing of putting ideas down on paper.

This blog will likely be focused mostly on programming and software.
I probably will deviate to other personal interests of mine, such as D&D.
